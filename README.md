For this project, I used Pytorch as the primary library for this task.
Also, used the U-net neural network for the image segmentation of eyeglasses.
PyTorch serves as the foundational framework for implementing deep learning 
models like U-Net, offering a robust set of tools for building, training, and deploying neural networks. 
Within PyTorch, U-Net architecture can be easily constructed and trained 
using its high-level APIs and efficient computational graph execution. 
U-Net, in turn, leverages PyTorch's capabilities to perform image segmentation tasks effectively. 
With its convolutional layers and skip connections, U-Net excels at capturing 
spatial information in images, making it particularly well-suited for tasks such as
medical image segmentation where precise localization of structures is crucial. 
Therefore, the correlation between PyTorch, U-Net, and image segmentation lies in 
their complementary roles: PyTorch provides the framework for implementation, 
U-Net offers the specific architecture tailored for segmentation tasks, 
and image segmentation serves as the application domain where these tools are applied to extract meaningful information 
from images.
